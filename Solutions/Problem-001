Problem:
Get the Sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below n
Approach:
Rather than brute-forcing all the multiples of 3 and 5
and getting their sum, I'll use the series summation to 
get the sum of the multiples immediately. This has a flaw
though, since there will be duplicates added to the sum
due to 3 and 5 having similar multiples. This, however 
can be corrected by subtracting the summation of the
multiples of 15

Summation Algorithm:
for getting the sum of 1..n
(1 + n) * n / 2 or (n * n + n) / 2  => To ensure the sum stays as an integer
i.e.
Getting the sum of 1..9
(1+9)*9/2
10*4.5
=>45
Getting the sum of 1..100
(1+100)*100/2
101*50
=>5050

def multiples(n)
  n -= 1
	max3, max5, max15 = n/3, n/5, n/15	#Getting the highest nth multiples 
	3 * (max3 * max3 + max3)/2 + 				#summation of all multiples of 3
	5 * (max5 * max5 + max5)/2 - 				#summation of all multiples of 5
	15 * (max15 * max15 + max15)/2 			#summation of all multiples of 15
end
