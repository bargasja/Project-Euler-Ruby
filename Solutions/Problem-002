Problem:
Get the Sum of all even fibonacci numbers less than n

Approach:
A fibonacci sequence is made by adding the last two
numbers to get the next number. The problem states that
we get only the sum of even fibonacci numbers. Rather
than using brute-force, we can use a pattern that can be
observed when making a fibonacci series.

using the example:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

We can observe that:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
^o,^e,^o,^o,^e,^o, ^o, ^e, ^o, ^o, ... o - odd, e - even

We can expect this pattern to repeat since:
even + even = even
even + odd = odd  
odd + odd = even
